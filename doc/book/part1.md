# Part 1: Setup the application

This tutorial is intended to give an introduction to `Zend\Expressive` to
build PSR-7 middleware applications with the Zend Framework. In the 
tutorial you will build a simple database driven application step-by-step. 
At the end of the tutorial you will have a working ZF3 middleware 
application to use as a starting point for your own applications.
